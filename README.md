# Dave Hall's Dockerfiles

This repository contains a collection of Dockerfiles that I use for various
projects. Each directory has a README.md that gives information about that
file. The directories map to made available on under my profile on
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/skwashd/).

All of these images use [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/) as the base
Linux distro. 

These images are developed and supported by [Dave Hall
Consulting](https://davehall.com.au) with support of our clients. The images
are licensed under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE).

If you experience any problems with any of these images, please submit issues
or pull requests.
